# Wiki Edit Analyzer Improvement Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Architecture Improvements
- [x] Create a dedicated mapper service to convert between DTOs and domain models
  - Created WikiEventMapper to convert between WikimediaRecentChangeDto and WikiEvent
  - Implemented proper null checking and comprehensive JavaDoc comments
  - Updated services to use the mapper for better separation of concerns

### Code Quality Improvements
- [x] Extract configuration properties to a dedicated configuration class
  - Created ApplicationConfig with @ConfigurationProperties
  - Organized properties into logical groups (Kafka, Wikimedia)
  - Updated services to use the configuration class instead of @Value annotations
  - Added backward compatibility for existing property names

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Architecture**
   - Better separation of concerns with dedicated mapper service
   - Clear distinction between external data representation (DTOs) and internal domain models
   - More maintainable and testable code structure

2. **Enhanced Configuration Management**
   - Centralized configuration properties in one place
   - Type-safe access to configuration properties
   - Better organization of properties into logical groups
   - Default values ensure the application works with minimal configuration

3. **Better Documentation**
   - Comprehensive JavaDoc comments for new classes
   - Detailed implementation notes for each improvement
   - Updated tasks list with progress tracking

## Recently Completed Tasks

1. **Refactor the WikimediaStreamConsumer to use dependency injection for WebClient** ✓
   - Created WebClientConfig class with a configured WebClient bean
   - Injected the WebClient into the WikimediaStreamConsumer
   - Improved testability and configurability
   - Added JavaDoc comments for better documentation

2. **Add health checks to the Docker container** ✓
   - Added Spring Boot Actuator for health endpoints
   - Configured health endpoints in application.properties
   - Updated Dockerfile to include health checks
   - Added curl to the Docker image for health check commands

3. **Implement proper null checking and validation in all services** ✓
   - Added Bean Validation annotations to the WikiEvent domain model
   - Created a dedicated ValidationService for centralized validation
   - Implemented validation in the WikimediaStreamConsumer
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

4. **Add unit tests for all service classes** ✓
   - Created test fixtures and mock dependencies
   - Added tests for ValidationService
   - Added tests for WikimediaStreamConsumer
   - Tested both happy path and error scenarios

## Next Steps

Based on the tasks list, the following improvements would be good candidates for the next implementation:

1. **Implement a proper layered architecture with clear separation of concerns**
   - Create separate packages for controllers, services, repositories, and domain models
   - Define clear interfaces between layers
   - Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application

2. **Add a circuit breaker pattern for the Wikimedia stream connection**
   - Implement Resilience4j or Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker
   - Configure fallback mechanisms for stream failures
   - Add monitoring for circuit breaker status

3. **Implement a message retry mechanism for failed Kafka messages**
   - Configure Kafka producer retry properties
   - Implement a dead letter queue for failed messages
   - Add monitoring for message delivery status

## Conclusion

The Wiki Edit Analyzer project has made significant progress in improving its architecture and code quality. The completed tasks have laid a solid foundation for further improvements. By continuing to work through the tasks list, the project will become more maintainable, testable, and robust.
