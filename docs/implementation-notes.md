# Implementation Notes: Dedicated Mapper Service

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a dedicated mapper service for converting between DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and domain models in the Wiki Edit Analyzer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created WikiEventMapper
- Created a new mapper service class `WikiEventMapper` in the `sk.fischio.wikistreamkafka.mapper` package
- Implemented methods to convert between `WikimediaRecentChangeDto` and `WikiEvent` domain model
- Added comprehensive JavaDoc comments to explain the purpose and functionality
- Implemented proper null checking to handle edge cases

### 2. Updated WikimediaStreamConsumer
- Added the `WikiEventMapper` as a dependency
- Modified the stream processing logic to convert DTOs to domain models
- Updated logging to use domain model properties

### 3. Updated KafkaProducerService
- Added a new method to handle `WikiEvent` domain models
- Implemented proper error handling for serialization exceptions
- Added JavaDoc comments to explain the purpose of the new method

## Benefits of the Changes

### Improved Separation of Concerns
- The mapper service now handles the responsibility of converting between external data representations (DTOs) and internal domain models
- Services can focus on their core responsibilities without dealing with data conversion logic

### Better Maintainability
- Changes to the data model or DTO structure only require updates in one place (the mapper)
- Reduces code duplication by centralizing conversion logic

### Enhanced Testability
- The mapper can be tested independently of the services that use it
- Makes it easier to mock domain models in service tests

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the mapper service
- Consider using a mapping library like MapStruct for more complex mapping scenarios
- Implement validation in the mapper to ensure data integrity
