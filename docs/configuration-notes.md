# Configuration Improvements: Dedicated Configuration Class

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a dedicated configuration class for centralizing and managing application properties in the Wiki Edit Analyzer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ApplicationConfig Class
- Created a new configuration class `ApplicationConfig` in the `com.example.wikistreamkafka.config` package
- Used `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind properties with the "application" prefix
- Organized properties into logical groups (Kafka, Wikimedia)
- Added default values for properties to ensure the application works even if properties are not defined

### 2. Updated application.properties
- Restructured properties to use the new prefix structure
- Added property placeholders for backward compatibility
- Organized properties into logical sections with clear comments

### 3. Updated Services to Use ApplicationConfig
- Removed `@Value` annotations from services
- Added ApplicationConfig as a dependency to services that need configuration properties
- Updated code to use the configuration class instead of directly injected properties
- Used a consistent approach for accessing properties across all services

## Benefits of the Changes

### Centralized Configuration Management
- All configuration properties are now defined and documented in one place
- Changes to property names or structures only need to be updated in one place
- Default values ensure the application works even with minimal configuration

### Type-Safe Configuration
- Properties are now strongly typed, reducing the risk of type conversion errors
- IDE auto-completion and navigation support makes it easier to work with properties
- Validation can be added to ensure property values meet requirements

### Better Organization
- Properties are organized into logical groups, making it easier to understand their purpose
- Clear separation between different types of configuration (Kafka, Wikimedia, etc.)
- Consistent naming conventions make properties more discoverable

## Next Steps
- Add validation to ensure property values meet requirements
- Implement environment-specific configuration profiles
- Add documentation for all configuration properties
- Consider using a configuration server for centralized configuration management in a microservices environment
